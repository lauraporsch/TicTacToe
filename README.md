# TicTacToe
Text based, command-line Tic Tac Toe game, Python

Playable against another Player or Computer.
First try of letting a program make "smart" choices.
The Computer checks on every move if there is a possibility to win and if yes, plays accordingly.
If there is no opportunity to win, computer checks if there is an opportunity for the player to win, if applicable, hinders the player to win.

The code for the "smart choices" is quite long and not easy to read. I am looking for an easier option. Ideas are welcome.

Two-Player Mode:
